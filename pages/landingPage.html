    <div class="about-me-text-container">
        <p class="about-me-text cinzel-font">I grew up in a small town, had a pretty normal childhood. I spent the majority of my highschool years not caring
        about school and learning, when I graduated, I had nothing lined up. Last minute I was able to get into an
        Automotive Technology Associate's degree program where most of the academic classes were low level and didn't
        require much effort. After an internship to get into the second year of school and completing that program, I began
        my first job as a BMW Automotive Technician with Wagner BMW of Shrewsbury. A few years later I moved on to BMW of
        Boston where I honed my skills as a Technician but also went into the Dispatcher career and then again, shifted into
        Service Advising. I spent a solid 6 years being a Service Advisor for BMW of Boston and gained some incredible
        knowledge about people and being a professional when it comes to communication. During this time, I invested in a
        multi-family property and became pretty good at fixing things and managing money, again developing more skills
        necessary for every day life. </p>

        <p class="about-me-text2 cinzel-font">After my father passing, it changed my perspective on life and I wanted more for
        myself. In 2022, I sold my property and quit my job to enroll myself in a bootcamp to learn backend Web Development,
        it was a great experience and I learned a ton about Java and Spring, since then, I have been on a quest of learning
        more and more about Software Engineering and Web Development. Which leads me to this, my first website. Welcome.</p>
